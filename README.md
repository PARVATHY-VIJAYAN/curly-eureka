# Strings
## Write Python programs for the following:

1.To accept a filename from the user and print the extension.

2.Given a string of odd length greater than 7, return a string made of the middle three chars of the given string. Sample String = "Pythonstrings" Expected Result: 'nst'

3.Count all lower case, upper case, digits, and special symbols from a given string. Given String: str1 = "P@#yn26at^&i5ve" Expected Output: Total counts of chars, digits,and symbols Chars = 8 Digits = 3 Symbol = 4 

4. To find the longest and the smallest word in a string.

5.To check if a given string is a Palindrome. (A palindrome reads same from front and back. e.g. Madam, Bob, level.) 6. To generate a new string from a given one where all occurrences of its first char are replaced by '$', except the first char itself. Sample String: 'onion' Expected Result: 'oni$n. Sample String: ' people of philippines' Expected Result: ' peo$le of $hili$$ines'

7.To add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given one already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged. Sample String: 'sky'. Expected Result: 'skying'. Sample String: 'being'. Expected Result: 'beingly'. Sample String: 'in'. Expected Result: 'in'.
